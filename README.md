# hello-world
This is my first github repository

This is my attempt at editing the readme and comitting the changes therein.
Hopefully i can use this to learn a bit more about other peoples attempts at programming games stuff for unity and c# in general.
I will start the tutorial on roguebasin dealing with c# and a few other libraries in the coming weeks. :D Yay feeling good about this!
